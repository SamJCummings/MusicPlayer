# Music Player (Name Pending)

Currently a work in progress (WIP) application to play music from mp3s. Written in Rust, 
using Cursive to create a Text User Interface (TUI), this application aims to act as a **very**
simple mp3 player working with simple file structures. It is an application I am aiming to make
for personal use, and to learn both rust and TUI programming.
